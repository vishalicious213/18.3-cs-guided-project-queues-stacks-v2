"""
Your goal is to define a `Queue` class that uses two stacks. Your `Queue` class
should have an `enqueue()` method and a `dequeue()` method that ensures a
"first in first out" (FIFO) order.

As you write your methods, you should optimize for time on the `enqueue()` and
`dequeue()` method calls.

The Stack class that you will use has been provided to you.
